# Assembly-Project-
This purpose of this project is to add the sum of squares based off 
of the user's input. 

For example,
    the user will input a number from 1 to 9.
    If the user typed 4, then the program will automatically
    calculate the sum of squares that lead up to 4.
    So the calculation will go as follows;
    1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 which equals 30.
    So the program should output 30. 

This program is to demonstrate my capabilities and familiarity
with the Assembly language and its syntax.
The assembly-Project.txt file that is attatched to this depository 
has in-line comments to explain the logic of the program.
